| Levels Completed                | `int32`     |
| Lives Lost                      | `int32`     |
| Times Hit by Enemies            | `int32`     |
| Vehicle Type                    | `string`    |
| World                           | `string`    |
| Coins Spent in Toad Town        | `int32`     |
| Companion                       | `string`    |
